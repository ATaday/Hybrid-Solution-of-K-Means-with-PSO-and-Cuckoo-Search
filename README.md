# Hybrid-Solution-of-K-Means-with-PSO-and-Cuckoo-Search

This presents a k-means clustering approach for classifying and shows how the traditional k-means clustering algorithm can be modified to be used as a classifier algorithm. The proposed model comprises particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the traditional K-means algorithm to provide the requirements of a classifier. Also it combines cuckoo-search based evolutionary algorithm with some centroid-calculation heuristics.
